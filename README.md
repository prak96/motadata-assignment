Scenario-Based Problem Statement:
You are part of a Linux Infrastructure & Virtualization Operations team that supports mission-critical applications hosted across a hybrid environment â€” both on-premises (VMware vSphere/ESXi) and potentially cloud-integrated systems. Your Linux systems run inside VMware VMs, and your team is responsible for: 
â€¢ Managing performance, availability, and capacity of Linux VMs. 
â€¢ Monitoring and resolving issues across the virtualization and OS layer. 
â€¢ Automating system provisioning, recovery, and patching. 
â€¢ Implementing fault-tolerant configurations and disaster recovery. 
â€¢ Maintaining secure and hardened systems in compliance with best practices. 
You have access to AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Cursor, DeepSeek) to assist in prompt engineering, troubleshooting, automation scripting, and design thinking.

My Prompts
I have used OpenAI as ChatGPT to fulfil part of tasks as per above requirements:

Prompt-1:
do the same for - Diagnosing high CPU/memory/disk usage in a Linux VM hosted on vSphere by relying on shell scripts, YAML, ARM templates & other tools etc....based on my portfolio mentioned in my resume profile.

Sol.
Build a reliable, automated, and efficient framework to detect, diagnose, and optionally auto-remediate high CPU/Memory/Disk usage in Linux VMs â€” with hooks to VMware vSphere and cloud (e.g., Azure) if needed.


âœ… Phase 1: Metrics Collection & Real-Time Diagnosis
	1.2 Ansible Playbook to Automate & Fetch Reports
	
âœ… Phase 2: Monitoring & Auto-Trigger Logic (AI Optional)
	2.1 Setup Continuous Monitoring
	2.2 Auto-Diagnose & Notify via Ansible

âœ… Phase 3: Integration with Cloud (ARM Templates/YAML)
	3.1 Export vSphere VM Metrics to Azure Monitor (Optional Hybrid Setup)
	3.2 ARM Template for Scaling/Remediation (for Cloud-Hosted VMs)

âœ… Phase 4: Centralized Dashboard & Reporting
	4.1 SolarWinds Dashboards
	4.2 Scheduled Reports via Cron + Email

ðŸ“¦ Output
Youâ€™ll have a plug-n-play framework to:
o	Diagnose root cause of high resource usage
o	Get notified via logs/alerts
o	Optionally remediate or scale
o	Build dashboards and trends
o	Tie it to vSphere or Azure actions as needed
o	Webhook to ServiceNow or ITSM for ticketing

â€ƒ
Prompt-2:

now do the same for a part of my above requirement - automating Monitoring VM performance via VMware Tools integration (guest metrics), with same request as described before (using tools known as per my resume profile)

Sol.
âœ… PHASE 1: Understand VMware Guest Metrics (via VMware Tools)

âœ… PHASE 2: Shell Script to Collect Guest Metrics via VMware Tools

âœ… PHASE 3: Automate with Ansible + YAML

âœ… PHASE 4: Alerting with Thresholds

âœ… PHASE 7: ARM Template Hook (for Cloud-integrated Actions)



MY ANALYSIS:
This is my approach to part of the problem scenario stated!

Mostly I will go with this roadmap irrespective the tools i use (For example: I will use YAML is some case than Ansible vice versa).

LAB:
I also did try implementing the automate SystemStat for LINUX VM through CICD using YAML & Shell scripts. But to error in my Azure account unable to link the services to deploy & execute my script.

Therefore I pasted the artifacts of error. 

I already have implemented this and weel aquainted with having good hands on experience, using it in my work place too. 

OUTPUT:
Irrespecive to all, this I ran the Shell script to generate monitoring stat of my LINUX VM (CPU, MEMORY, Drives etc..) by giving Execute Permission. 
PASTED THE ARTIFACTS as well.
